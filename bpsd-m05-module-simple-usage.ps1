# To use a module, you first need to import it
Import-Module $module

# Show list of modules in memory
Get-Module 

# Now the functions in the module are ready for your use. 
Write-One

Write-Two

# Note, if you go to the module and make a change, and reimport, it doesn't
# actually reload since it is already in memory

# Go to the Write-One function and change the return then run this code
Import-Module $module
Write-One                 # Still returns original data

# Because the module is already loaded, by default PS won't reload
# To force it to reload, you have to use the -Force switch
Import-Module -Force $module
Write-One

# Note variables in the module won't appear here
# Try to display a variable declared in the module, won't show anything
Import-Module -Force $module

# They are scoped to the module.
# To create a public variable, use "Global"
$Global:scopedGlobal 

# Globals can cause all kinds of issues. Much better to use functions

Write-ITM 'Arcane Code'

# You can unload a module from memory
Remove-Module $moduleName
